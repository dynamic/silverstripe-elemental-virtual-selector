# Silverstripe Elemental Virtual Selector

An enhancement to the virtual block selector. Filter existing blocks by block type so it's easier to find the element you're looking for. The element title is also augmented to include the page title.

## Installation

```sh
composer require dynamic/silverstripe-elemental-virtual-selector
```

## Documentation

- [Documentation readme](docs/en/README.md)

Add links into your `docs/<language>` folder here unless your module only requires minimal documentation
in that case, add here and remove the docs folder. You might use this as a quick table of content if you
mhave multiple documentation pages.

## Example configuration

If your module makes use of the config API in Silverstripe CMS it's a good idea to provide an example config
here that will get the module working out of the box and expose the user to the possible configuration options.
Though note that in many cases simply linking to the documentation is enough.

Provide a syntax-highlighted code examples where possible.

```yaml
Page:
  config_option: true
  another_config:
    - item1
    - item2
```
